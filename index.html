      <h2>About Vivek Sivakumar</h2>
      <p>Vivek Sivakumar is a cloud architect and writer who divides his life between building digital worlds and crafting literary ones. He is the creator of writervivek.com, where his stories in Tamil have drawn praise for their emotional depth and sharp satire. His work often explores the intersection of the absurd and the profound—grounded in South Indian life, yet resonant across cultures.

When Crows Wore Sunglasses marks his debut in English fiction—a bold and imaginative collection that blends surrealism, social critique, and unexpected tenderness. Vivek lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife and children, and writes late into the night, guided by the belief that stories—like crows in sunglasses—can see the world differently.
